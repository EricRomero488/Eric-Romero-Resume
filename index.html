        <div class="subheading mb-5">Art MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I've always been fascinated by art, but it wasn't until I was a middleÂ school student that I decided I wanted to dedicate my life to it. I developed my talents in a variety of artistic mediums throughout my stay at UCR, including digital art, sculpting, and drawing in addition to painting and sketching. It was after years of self-discovery and many hours of painting, drawing, and experimenting with different artistic materials that the decision to major in art was made. Since I was a young kid, art has always been a part of my life. It provided a safe haven where I could escape reality and find comfort in the realm of shapes and colors. I was able to traverse the complexity of life and explain the inarticulable and inexpressible via my work.
Exposure to a wide range of artistic materials and styles has been one of the most thrilling elements of my undergraduate art major experience. My academic path has been an engaging investigation of the endless possibilities of art, spanning from the traditional disciplines of drawing and painting to the cutting-edge fields of digital art and installation. My exposure to such a wide range of artistic mediums has given me the freedom to try new things, push limits, and find my own voice as an artist.
<br><br>

        I've had the honor of going to galleries, museums, and exhibitions that feature the creations of well-known international artists. My understanding of the potential of art to represent society, culture, and human expression has grown as a result of these encounters. The works of talented individuals like Picasso, Van Gogh, and Frida Kahlo, each of whom made an enduring impression on the world via their art, have served as inspiration for me. My time in college has not only helped me polish my creative abilities but also given me a more comprehensive understanding of the place of art in society. I now realize that art is a potent vehicle for activism, social criticism, and communication in addition to being a lonely act of creation. I have studied how art has influencedÂ movements, challenged social norms, and started important discussions about important topics.
        <br><br>

        The chance to exhibit my art to a larger audience has been one of the most rewarding parts of my career. It has been an exciting experience for me to display my artwork at student exhibitions and neighborhood galleries. It has helped me understand how my art affects other people and has inspired me to keep exploring the limits of my creativity. These breakthroughs have strengthened my resolve to pursue painting as a career. As an art major, my path is a work in progress, a continuous story of self-exploration, artistic development, and the unwavering quest of creativity. I'm looking forward to see where my journey takes me next as I continue to paint the picture of my life as anÂ artistÂ with every brushstroke, composition, and creation.
